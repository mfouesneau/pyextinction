pyextinction -- A tool using stellar extinction curves 
======================================================

This is a set of tools to compute and apply extinction curves in a simple way,
ideal to integrate in larger projects.

full documentation at: http://mfouesneau.github.io/docs/pyextinction/

The inputs are photonic or energetic response functions for the desired
photometric bands and stellar spectra. The modules are flexible to handle units 
in the wavelength definition through a simplified version of `pint` (link)
